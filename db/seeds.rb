content: "Stacey Castor almost got away with it. She wanted people to believe that her life had been crippled by tragedy - that her first husband had died of a heart attack, her second husband had died by poisoning himself with antifreeze, and that her daughter had also attempted suicide. But, according to police, all of it was a lie - and the seemingly unfortunate wife and mother was actually a cold-blooded killer, now known by many as the Black Widow. Stacey Ruth Castor may have been one of the most sociopathic female serial killers in modern times. She poisoned her first husband Michael Wallace with anti-freeze after he becomes an inconvenience to her and did the same to her second husband David Castor years later. When she caught wind that the police were onto her methods, she poisoned her own daughter and wrote a confession letter on her behalf. She tried to pin the crimes on her daughter. Dubbed the Black Widow by the national media, recent findings have opened up the possibility that Stacey killed her own father as well. Cool, calm and collected, Stacey maintained her innocence throughout the court proceedings, adamantly pointing the finger of blame at her own daughter. But what possessed her to kill not only her husbands but her own flesh and blood?",

content: "Chris Watts is now known as a calculating and ruthless killer, as well as an adulterer and a liar. But before the horrific crimes he committed in the early hours of Aug. 13, 2018, Chris possessed the facade of a consummate family man. Then 33 years old, Chris lived with his family in Frederick, Colorado, southeast of Longmont. Married for nearly six years, he and wife Shanann had two daughters â€” Bella, age 4, and Celeste, age 3 â€” and were expecting a third. Chris was employed by Anadarko Petroleum, while Shanann, 34, worked at a call center for a childrens hospital. They appeared happy in family photos. But looks, as is so often the case, can be deceiving. The Watts had filed for bankruptcy in June 2015, after becoming buried in debt by their mortgage, credit cards, medical bills and student loans. By late summer 2018, Chris was having an affair with Nichol Kessinger, whom he met through work. He purportedly claimed to be separated from his wife, and that a divorce was imminent. Instead, however, Chris was coldly planning the murder of his family, including their unborn child. Chris felt trapped by his marriage and growing family, and wanted to start a new life with Nichol. But rather than seeking therapy, or filing for divorce and working out terms for support and custody, Chris chose to do the unimaginable.",

content: "Shannon Lloyd was killed in 1987 and Renee Cuevas in 1989. Two decades-old cold case murders in California have been solved through the novel investigative tool of genetic genealogy, authorities announced. The first victim was 23-year-old Shannon Rose Lloyd, who was was sexually assaulted and strangled to death in her Garden Grove bedroom in May 1987, Garden Grove Deputy Police Chief Amir El Farra said. Renee Cuevas, 27, was killed two years later, he said. In 2003, police determined the same man committed both crimes and his DNA was submitted to the law enforcement database CODIS. No suspect was identified, El Farra said. Then last year, authorities turned to genetic genealogy, which uses an unknown suspects DNA to trace his or her family tree. Genetic genealogy made headlines in 2018 when it was used to find the Golden State Killer. Genetic genealogy takes an unknown suspects DNA left at a crime scene and identifies it using family members who voluntarily submit DNA samples to a DNA database. Police can then create a much larger family tree than if they only used databases like CODIS. Genetic genealogy identified Reuben Smith, who lived in Orange County in the 1980s, as a possible suspect.",

content: "Peterson went missing on Christmas Eve 2002 while she was eight months pregnant with a son she had named Connor. Throughout early 2003, her disappearance dominated the TV news right alongside the hunt for Saddam Hussein. The tragic story established a cast of characters who covered tabloid magazines for years, including Lacis handsome husband Scott Peterson, Scotts mistress, and a gaggle of celebrity lawyers. The tangled drama proved that even with other, more serious problems in the world, Americans had a bottomless appetite for true crime. Before you dive back into the story that captivatedâ€”and distractedâ€”millions, here is what you need to know about Laci Peterson disappearance and death. On December 24th, 2002, Scott and Laci Peterson woke together at their home in Modesto, California. After eating breakfast and watching some TV, Scott left to go fishing while Laci took the couples dog for a walk. Later that day, a neighbor found their dog, still wearing a leash, wandering in front of the house by himself. Scott Peterson told police he first drove to his nearby warehouse to send emails and retrieve his boat, which he brought to Berkeley Marina. Indeed, the evidence - timestamped emails and a receipt from the marina backed him up. After about 90 minutes of fishing, Scott said, he returned his boat to the warehouse, went home to an empty house and showered. Scott told investigators that he assumed Laci had gone to her mothers house. He called his mother-in-law, looking for his wife. Half an hour later, Lacis stepfather called 911 to report that she was missing.",

content: "Throughout history, people around the world have been captivated by the topic of serial murderers, primarily because they can not understand why an individual would be willing to take not only one life but multiple. Numerous sociologists and criminologists have dedicated their entire lives to the research of individuals who prey upon other human beings. As a result, there is never a shortage of information about what makes a serial killer and even how that serial killer grew up. With an estimated 500 serial killers living and working in unsuspecting communities, understanding the origins and or causes for their anti-social and psychopathic tendencies is of the utmost interest and importance to researchers and law enforcement officials. Statistically, these sadistic individuals are believed to be responsible for 3500 to 5000 murders every year. Current research on individuals with anti-social and psychopathic tendencies has revealed copious amounts of information on the serial murderers psyche, biological development, and environmental development, very little research has focused on the elements of a serial murderers youth, which may have played a crucial part in violent behavior later in life. In this exploratory case study, the author will focus on the American serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, tracing the source of his psychopathic tendencies back to his childhood neglect and resulting emotional abuse, his fascination with death, and discussing how this may have influenced his opinion of the value of his own life in comparison to the value of the lives of his seventeen young victims.",

content: "University of Idaho murders suspect Bryan Kohberger may have held onto an ID belonging to one of the four killed in the shocking November stabbings, sources claimed this week. Kohberger, 28, was arrested in Pennsylvania on Dec. 30 - six weeks after Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin were murdered in their off-campus home in Moscow. At the time of the killings, Kohberger was a doctoral student in criminal justice at Washington State University in Pullman, just 15 miles from Moscow. Kohberger, who has not yet entered a plea to four counts of murder and one of felony burglary, is in custody in Latah County, Idaho. He is due back in court on June 26. The killings of four University of Idaho students in mid-November at an off-campus residence stunned the small community of Moscow, where investigators grappled with what the town's police chief would later describe as a very complex case. A vigil is held at the University of Idaho in honor of the victims, with some family members in attendance. We are going to get our justice, Steven Goncalves, Kaylees father, says, adding that his daughter and Mogen had been best friends since the sixth grade and he had learned that they were in the same bed when they were killed. They went to high school together, then they started looking at colleges, they came here together. They eventually get into the same apartment together, he said. And in the end, they died together.",

content: "Vallow, 49, is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of her children, Tylee Ryan and JJ Vallow, as well as the murder of Tammy Daybell, her husband Chad Daybells ex-wife. Vallow has pleaded not guilty to all charges. As the images were shared in court on Tuesday afternoon, the grandfather of one of the slain children sobbed in the back of the room. The kids went missing in 2019, sparking a nationwide search that ended when their bodies were found buried in an Eastern Idaho yard the following year. The yard belonged to Chad Daybell, Lori Vallows fifth husband. He is also charged with multiple counts of conspiracy, murder and grand theft in connection with the deaths of the children. Prosecutors charged them with the 2019 murder of Daybells ex-wife, too. Rexburg, Idaho, Det. Ray Hermosillo was the only witness to take the stand Tuesday. He discussed the origins of the investigation, as well the condition of the childrens bodies when they were found. Photos shared Tuesday were exceedingly graphic. In one image, JJ could be seen in red pajamas and socks, with duct tape covering his mouth and tying his arms and legs together. His arms were heavily bruised and his body had partially decomposed after having been buried for the eight months it took authorities to find them. In other images, Tylees remains were shown destroyed and burned, packed into a melted green bucket and buried at various locations on Daybells property. The evidence was so graphic that at one point, Vallows defense attorneys requested that she be removed for the rest of the days testimony to protect her already-distraught mental state. But Judge Steven Boyce had her remain in the courtroom, claiming her presence was vital to a fair trial.",
